# the builder first, in the abuild group with passwordless sudo, which
# is abuild's standard setup. The package version comes from the
# checkout's version file, and a throwaway signing key is made when
# the user has none. Writes tigris-<version>-r0.apk (and tigris-doc)
# into OUTDIR (default: the checkout). Needs abuild, tar and gzip.
