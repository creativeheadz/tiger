# The enabled units are links in *.wants directories under
# Tiger_Sysctl_Root; systemctl is a script (Tiger_Systemctl_Cmd) that
# answers "cat" with prepared text, laid out as systemctl cat lays it out.
# Units whose permissions are tested name files under the test's own
# directory; the ones that test where a unit comes from name the usual
# /etc and /usr/lib paths, which need not exist for that. Files belong to
# whoever runs the test, so ownership is asserted relative to that.
