# tests/pathmsg_check.sh - pathmsg gives each finding the letter of its level
#
# pathmsg (initdefs) is given an id for "not owned by" and one for
# "writable by", without their last letter, and decides the level from the
# file: it then adds the letter, so every id it reports names one level as
# the JSON schema requires. It reads lgetpermit lines (component, owner,
# group, then the nine permission bits and setuid, setgid, sticky); here
# they are written by hand for a real executable and a real directory.
