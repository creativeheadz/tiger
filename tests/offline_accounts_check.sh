# tests/offline_accounts_check.sh - the account checks on an offline root
#
# Builds a root with accounts that are wrong in known ways and runs
# tigris --root on it with the account checks on: a second uid-0 account,
# an empty password, a duplicate uid, a disabled account with a shell, a
# .rhosts and a crontab (where Debian keeps crontabs), a world-writable
# home, password aging off, a securetty that lets root in remotely, and
# '.' in root's PATH. Each must be reported, by the root's paths and with
# owners named from the root's passwd, never this host's. root's .profile
# also tries to make Tigris write a file through a redirection
# (PATH=...>file): nothing may be written. check_passwd needs root (a live
# shadow file is root's): as a user it must be skipped as such, and as root
# its findings are checked too. CI runs this both ways.
