# tests/offline_services_check.sh - the services and aliases checks on an offline root
#
# Builds a root with a services file and mail aliases that are wrong in
# known ways and runs tigris --root on it with both checks on: two
# services sharing a port, an unknown local service, a uudecode program
# alias, a world-writable handler, a program that is not there, an
# include file with a nested program alias, and an alias through an
# absolute symlink that must resolve inside the root (this host has no
# /linkprog, so the finding proves it). Owners are named from the
# root's passwd. inet002f is not covered: that leg matches the port
# against itself, so it cannot fire on either side.
