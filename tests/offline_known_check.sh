# tests/offline_known_check.sh - the intrusion-signs check on an offline root
#
# Builds a root with intrusions planted in known places and runs
# tigris --root on it with the check on: a shell in inetd.conf, a
# trojan path, a plain file where only sockets belong, junk in two
# lost+found directories, BACKDOOR in /bin/login, and a mail spool
# file owned by somebody else. The promiscuous and setuid probes read
# the running system, so they must stay quiet, never fail. As root a
# second spool file belongs to no user at all.
