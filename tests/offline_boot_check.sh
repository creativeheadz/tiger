# tests/offline_boot_check.sh - the boot checks on an offline root
#
# Two roots run with the boot and single-user checks on. The first has
# a group- and world-readable lilo.conf with no password and a
# group- and world-readable grub.cfg that does set one: every leg must
# be reported by the root's own paths. Its lilo.conf also keeps the
# single-user check silent, as on a live system. The second root has
# no boot loader configuration at all but an inittab without sulogin:
# the missing configuration and the missing sulogin line must both be
# reported. check_lilo needs root (the boot loader's configuration is
# root's): as a user it must be skipped as such, and as root its
# findings are checked too. CI runs this both ways.
