# tests/dns_check.sh - check_dns against a root of its own

# A fake root with a resolv.conf holding four servers and a bad line,
# an unbound opening recursion from an included file, and a bind opening
# it through a named ACL. Then roots with no usable nameserver, a single
# real one, a lone loopback stub (fine), an authoritative-only bind
# (recursion no: not analyzed), and clean daemon configurations.
