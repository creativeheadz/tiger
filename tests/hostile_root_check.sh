# tests/hostile_root_check.sh - an offline root cannot make Tigris run code
#
# tigris --root reads images that may be hostile, and runs as root to do
# it. Whatever it reads from one is data, and none of it may be run. This
# root plants a command in each place a check once parsed as shell code:
# an account's name, password hash, shell and home directory, a line of
# /etc/shells, a
# group name, a file name in /dev, /etc/hostname (matched against
# bootparams), a value in sshd_config, a program name in root's PATH
# (built into an awk program), a top-level directory's name (built into
# a sed script). Each command is a bare redirection
# that would create a file named pwned.* in the directory Tigris runs
# from, so a Tigris that fails this test is not harmed by it. None may
# appear, and the checks must still report what they report on a fair
# root. CI runs this as a user and as root.
