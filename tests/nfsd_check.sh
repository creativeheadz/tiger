# tests/nfsd_check.sh - check_nfsd against fixtures of its own
#
# rpcinfo output and nfsd threads are fixture files (Tiger_RPCInfo_Cmd
# and Tiger_ProcDir), /etc/exports comes from a root of its own
# (Tiger_Sysctl_Root, as tigris --root sets it): a daemon serving with
# nothing exported (nfs015w), serving with exports (nothing), nothing
# serving with exports and idle threads (nfs016i), the same with
# running threads (an NFSv4-only server: nothing), and an rpcinfo that
# fails (nothing can be said either way: nothing). Runs as a user and
# as root; nothing here needs privilege.
