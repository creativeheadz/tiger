# Run as root in a throwaway Fedora (or other RPM), Alpine or Arch
# container, as tests/deb_checks.sh does for Debian. It modifies one
# packaged binary, deletes another, changes the mode of a third and adds a
# stray file to /usr/bin, runs pkg_integrity from a root-owned copy of this
# tree and checks that exactly those four are reported, with the same
# message ids the Debian checks use. Then it copies the container's root,
# changes and all, into a directory and audits that as an offline root
# (TIGRIS_ROOT, as tigris --root sets it): the report must be the same.
#
# Exit 0 when every assertion holds, 1 otherwise, 2 when it cannot run.
