# tests/listening_check.sh - check_listeningprocs against ss, lsof and
# netstat fixtures
#
# Two runs of lsof -F output that differ only in the ports the kernel gave
# out (UDP clients such as browsers and Syncthing hold several, and they
# change every run). The findings must be the same in both, with the ports
# in the detail, so tigris --since does not report them as new each time.
# Fixed ports keep their own finding, loopback and connected sockets are
# left out, and a root listener on every interface is a WARN only, not a
# WARN and an INFO.
#
# Then IPv6, from each of the three tools the check can read: listeners on
# [::] and dual-stack sockets are reported, a process on 0.0.0.0 and on ::
# is one finding, ::1 is loopback, and ss's owner uids become names.
