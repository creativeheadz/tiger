# tests/offline_scan_check.sh - the file system scan of an offline root
#
# Runs tigris --root with the scan on (setuid, setgid, world-writable
# directories, unowned files, links, odd names, devices) over a root that
# holds one of each: a setuid program no package ships, a setgid script, a
# world-writable directory, a directory named "...", an absolute link to a
# file this host has and the root does not (dangling inside the root; it
# must not be followed to this host's file), and one to a file the root
# has (not dangling). The root's passwd knows the files' uid but its group
# file does not know their gid, though this host does: every file must
# then be one "without a defined group", which only the root's group file
# can say. Every finding must name the root's paths. As root a device file
# outside /dev is added. Needs GNU find.
