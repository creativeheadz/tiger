# tests/offline_umask_check.sh - the umask checks on an offline root
#
# Three roots, each wrong in a known way, run with the two umask checks
# on. The first has an insecure UMASK in /etc/login.defs (this host's
# is correct, so the finding proves the root's file was read), shell
# start-up files with no umask anywhere, an empty /etc/csh/login.d, no
# dash or bash, and an executable /bin/csh this host does not have: the
# csh warning must fire (the root's /bin was probed) while the dash and
# bash warnings stay silent (this host's /bin was not). The second root
# is a systemd system, so its insecure /etc/init.d/rc must be silently
# skipped; it also has no login.defs and an insecure file dropped in
# /etc/csh/login.d, which must be reported by its own path. The third
# root's common-session lacks pam_umask while this host's has it, with
# bash installed and no umask anywhere: the bash warning must fire.
