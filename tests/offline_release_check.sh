# tests/offline_release_check.sh - the release check, on roots made of
# the real release files of current and past distributions
#
# Each root holds what the distribution's own image holds (os-release as
# shipped, debian_version, redhat-release), and the date is fixed
# (Tiger_Today) so the verdicts do not drift as releases age. A supported
# release says nothing; one past the end of its security support is
# osv002f, naming the date and any paid extended support; Debian testing
# is osv004w; Red Hat Linux, before RHEL, is osv001f. Ubuntu's
# debian_version says "trixie/sid" and must not read as Debian testing;
# RHEL's family and Fedora were misread from redhat-release until
# October 2026. One full run checks the JSON against the schema and that
# no finding names where the root is on this host.
