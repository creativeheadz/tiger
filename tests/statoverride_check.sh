# tests/statoverride_check.sh - deb_statoverride against a list of overrides
#
# Feeds the check a "dpkg-statoverride --list" of its own through
# Tiger_Deb_StatOverride_Cmd, for files this test creates, owned by whoever
# runs it: one that matches, one whose setgid bit is gone, one whose group
# is not the one set (written "#N"), one listed with a leading zero, one
# with a space in its name, and one that does not exist. Needs no root and
# no dpkg; tests/deb_checks.sh tries the real thing in a container.
