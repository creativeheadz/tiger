# tests/offline_exports_check.sh - the NFS exports check on an offline root
#
# Builds a root with exports and bootparams that are wrong in known
# ways and runs tigris --root on it with the check on: an anonymous
# uid 0 with write access, world exports both kinds, the root and /usr
# filesystems exported, and root access for a diskless client versus a
# stranger. The root's hostname differs from this host's, so the
# diskless match proves the host list came from the root. NIS is never
# consulted for a root.
