# tests/offline_check.sh - tigris --root: auditing a system that is not running
#
# Builds a small root in a directory: PAM stacks with pam_pwquality and
# pam_faillock, and a pwquality.conf that is an absolute link to another
# file of that root, setting minlen = 6. Runs tigris --root on it with a
# profile that leaves seven checks on: check_pam, which reads an offline
# root; check_timesync, check_ntp and check_rootkit, which read the running
# system; check_signatures, which cannot read an offline root; and check_ssh
# and check_sudo, which can but need root. check_pam must report the root's
# minimum length, read through the link inside the root; check_timesync,
# check_ntp, check_rootkit and check_signatures must be skipped, each with
# its reason, and check_ssh and check_sudo too when this is not root; the run
# record names the root, and the run exits 3 (a
# WARN): a check that does not apply to an offline root is not one that
# failed to run. Then
# util/rootpath on its own (links that would leave the root, loops), the
# paths --root refuses (con014e), and tigris-diff's notes on two runs, one
# of the root and one of the running system. Needs no root.
