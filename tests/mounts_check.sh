#
# A hard NFS or CIFS mount whose server is down blocks every program that
# touches it. Feeds gen_mounts a mount table and a probe that hangs on one
# mount point, and checks that the scan list leaves that mount and the
# network filesystems out, says so, and does not wait for it. Then runs
# check_accounts and check_path (every user, Tiger_Check_PATHALL=Y) over a
# passwd file with one home on the hanging mount and checks that only that
# account is skipped, with a message. Needs no root and touches nothing outside a temporary directory.
#
# Exit 0 when every assertion holds, 1 otherwise.
