# tests/nonroot_check.sh - checks that need root are skipped, and said to be

# Runs tigris with a profile that leaves four checks on: check_ssh (started
# through run_script) and check_sudo (started by systems/Linux/2/check),
# whose headers say "# Tigris: needs root", and check_secureboot and
# check_timesync, which do not. As an ordinary user the first two must be
# skipped: a "# Skipped" line each in the report, a skip record each in
# the JSON, "skipped":2 in the summary, an exit status of at least 2. As
# root nothing is skipped. Then tigris-diff, given a root run with a
# check_sudo finding and a user run that skipped check_sudo, must not call
# that finding resolved.
