# tests/firewall_check.sh - check_firewall against real rulesets
#
# The fixtures in tests/fixtures/firewall are "nft list ruleset" and
# "iptables -S INPUT" output captured from containers with their own
# network namespace (docker run --cap-add NET_ADMIN): nothing loaded, ufw
# enabled on Ubuntu 24.04, firewalld started on Fedora, and nftables
# configurations loaded with nft 1.1.3 on Debian stable. Each run feeds one
# of them through Tiger_NFT_Cmd and checks what is concluded for IPv4 and
# IPv6. Logging is covered both ways: verdicts with log rules stay
# silent, input without any is fire007w.
#
# The docker-* fixtures are the rules Docker writes for published ports:
# Hera (Docker 29.8.2, iptables-nft), and docker:dind containers (29.8.2
# with its iptables and its nftables backend, 27.5.1) publishing TCP and
# UDP ports on every address, one on loopback and one on the container's
# own address, and one on an IPv6 network, then ufw enabled beside them.
# The *.ipt files are the same rules as "iptables -S" prints them, which
# is what a host without nft (Ubuntu) gives.
