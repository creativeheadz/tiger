# tests/deb_checks.sh - the Debian package checks against planted problems
#
# Run as root in a throwaway Debian or Ubuntu container. It modifies one
# packaged binary, deletes another, adds a stray file to /usr/sbin, an
# override (dpkg-statoverride, without --update) that a binary does not
# match, and a removed-but-not-purged package in the dpkg status, then
# runs deb_checkmd5sums, deb_nopackfiles and deb_statoverride
# from a root-owned copy of this tree and checks that exactly those five
# are reported. Then it copies the container's root, changes and all, into
# a directory and runs the three on that as an offline root (TIGRIS_ROOT,
# as tigris --root sets it): the report must be the same.
#
# Exit 0 when every assertion holds, 1 otherwise, 2 when it cannot run.
