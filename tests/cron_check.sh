# tests/cron_check.sh - check_crontabs and gen_cron on a root of their own
#
# Builds a root (TIGRIS_ROOT, as tigris --root sets it) with cron jobs in
# every place cron reads them, and problems planted: a cron.d file anyone
# can write (cron008f), a cron.daily script its group can write (cron008w),
# a cron.d file that is not root's (cron009w), a job that runs a script
# anyone can write, with "--" among its arguments (which used to drop the
# job), a job by a relative path in a user's crontab (cron001w), a spool
# crontab for no account (cron010w), and one whose name is a command: it
# must not be run. A cron.d file whose name cron ignores (it has a dot)
# must be ignored, and /etc/crontab's "test -x ... ||" must not count as a
# relative path. Runs as a user and as root (then the system's files are
# given to root and the rest to an ordinary uid).
