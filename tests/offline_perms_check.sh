#!/bin/sh
#
# tests/offline_perms_check.sh - the permissions, devices and logfiles checks on an offline root
#
# Builds a root that is wrong in known ways and runs tigris --root on
# it with the three checks on: an /etc/passwd that is group- and
# world-writable and owned by milo (the database expects root's 644),
# a setuid /bin/login (unexpected) and a setuid /bin/su (expected: it
# must stay silent), a group-writable /bin/aaa that the database's
# /bin/* entry must find inside the root and not on this host, a
# regular file and an unexpected directory in
# /dev, an all-symlinks directory and an expected one that must stay
# silent, a btmp with the wrong mode, and missing wtmp and lastlog.
# Syslog stands in for messages; a second root with only a persistent
# journal must need no text log at all. As root the test also makes
# two device nodes and gives utmp to the utmp group (silence then
# proves the group was named from the root's group file); as a user
# utmp instead carries the wrong mode and is reported.
