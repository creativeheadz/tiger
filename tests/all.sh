# tests/all.sh - every fixture suite, one line each
#
# Runs tests/*_check.sh and prints each one's last line (PASS, or why it
# skipped); exits 1 when one failed. A suite that cannot run here (no
# python for JSON, no GNU find for the offline scan) says SKIP or "nothing
# to test" and does not fail. CI runs this under mawk, gawk and busybox
# awk, in Debian, Arch and Alpine containers; deb_checks.sh and
# pkg_checks.sh change the system they run on and have jobs of their own.
# Check authors take note: busybox awk rejects a literal brace outside
# a bracket expression (/{/ does not compile, and the whole program
# dies silent), so every awk regex spells one [{] or [}].
