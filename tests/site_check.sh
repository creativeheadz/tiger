# finding id and every framework, the index, the rendered documents and
# the files they need; every link from one page of it to another leads
# to a file that is there (anchors on the same page included); no markdown
# left unrendered (a stray ** or a [text](url)); and text from meta/ is
# escaped, so a < in an explanation cannot open a tag. Needs no network.
