# Five roots: AIDE configured with no database; AIDE with its
# database built; AFICK with no database (its name takes
# extensions); Samhain and osquery present; and an empty root,
# where no watcher is configured and nothing is said. INFO
# findings only show with Tiger_Show_INFO_Msgs=Y. Runs as a user
# and as root; the fixtures read the same for both.
