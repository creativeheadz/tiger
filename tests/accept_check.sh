# tests/accept_check.sh - accepted findings
#
# Uses tigris-accept to accept one finding outright, one with an expiry
# in the past and one with a message pattern that does not match, then
# runs check_sysctl against the all-bad fixture with JSON on. Checks that
# only the live acceptance leaves the text report, that the JSON keeps it
# marked accepted with the reason, and that list and delete work.
